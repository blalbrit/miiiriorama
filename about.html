	<h1>Miiiriorama</h1>
	<h2>Myrioramas and IIIF</h2>
	<p>In September, 2018, Emma Stanford presented at a conference hosted by the <a href="https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/">Cambridge Digital Library</a> on a number of puzzles and games that had been recently digitized and made available through the <a href="https://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/">Digital Bodleian</a>. One of the difficulties posed by these interactive games, from a digitization perspective, was the fact that they could only be delivered in static configurations. One could get a sense of how the game <hi>might</hi> have worked, but without the ability to actually try it out. The Myriorama games, decks of cards sold under various similar titles that presented endless combinations of landscape scenes when laid out side by side, were particularly problematic as, ideally, one would want to be able to shuffle and view the deck at will to digitally experience the game-play that a Victorian audience might have enjoyed. First appearing in 1823 in France, followed by several publications in 1824 in England, these games were usually 16 to 24 cards to a deck and depict landscapes full of gothic ruins, rustic homes, people engaged in various activities, and other elements that could be used to create a visual story. Each card has an independent scene that shares a set of common points (foreground, midground, and horizon) that match up with the other cards in the deck, allowing any card to appear in any order and still be part of a coherent scene. These decks appear in a number of museum and library collections - surviving in a variety of states - but surprisingly few have been digitized, aside from Oxford's lovely collection. Given their initial status as rather high-value drawing-room entertainments, and the hands-on nature of their use in play, patterns of damage and use are apparent in most decks.</p>

	<p>In her presentation, Emma suggested that <a href="https://iiif.io">IIIF</a> would be an excellent mechanism for producing a more interactive version of the static images provided by the Bodleian. Inspired, I quickly cropped some of the images to get coordinates to use with the <a href="https://iiif.io/api/image/3.0/">IIIF image API</a>, mocked up a simple drag-and-drop html site, and then promptly moved on to other things.</p>

	<p>In 2020, Stanford Libraries digitized <a href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/10404218">our own copy of the Myriorama game</a>, and I returned to the idea that Emma's presentation had sparked: could we use IIIF to easily build a digital representation of the combinatorial aspects that appealed to 19th-century audiences (advertising in the 1820s boasted of the length of time it might take to work through the more than 20 trillion scenes possible in a 16-card deck). One of the benefits of IIIF is that it allows us to use content from participating institutions as if it were held locally: instead of cropping and re-hosting each image from each deck at Stanford and Oxford, one only needs the coordinates desired from each image. That means we can build a website showing how a myriorama would work without ever having to host the images in that site; rather, we just pull them in from the hosting institution at viewing time. Not only does that approach save time and resources for the person building a site, but the hosting institution also gets to see their images being called directly from their servers, allowing them to point to usage statistics for their digital material which can help in the never-ending justification of funding for digitization of cultural heritage materials.</p>
	<p>The current site is not terribly elegant. I chose to allow for 8 cards to be viewed at a time from any deck selected from a list by the user, and simply present those cards in random order when the "Build a new Scene" button is clicked. There is nothing snazzy on the back-end: I have listed the URLs for the IIIF images and simply randomize the deck and present the first 8 cards. Things could get fancier, or be done better, in any number of ways, but the point here is to show how quickly and easily a site like this could be put together using content hosted at multiple institutions and not necessarily digitized in a way that made them obviously susceptible to this kind of use - and to give people unfamiliar with them a chance to see myrioramas in action. Basically, I just wanted to show how a simple site could become much more interesting by dynamically using image content served via IIIF.</p>
	<p>A quick note about the name of this site: in the old days of IIIF (the mid-twenty-teens) there was a bit of a vogue for using the "triple I" of IIIF in the names of software components associated with that particular flavor of interoperability (like <a href="https://github.com/edsilv/biiif/">biiif</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mbennett-uoe/whiiif">whiiif</a>, <a href="https://literarymachin.es/archiviiify/">Archiviiify</a>, and <a href="http://storiiies.cogapp.com/">Storiiies</a> to name a few); "Miiiriorama" takes its queue from those ground-breaking projects as a nod to its attempt to just be a site for myrioramas using IIIF.</p>
